    <h1>Quantum Computing</h1>
    <p>
      <strong>A quantum computer</strong> is a computer that exploits quantum
      mechanical phenomena. On small scales, physical matter exhibits properties
      of both particles and waves, and quantum computing leverages this behavior
      using specialized hardware. Classical physics cannot explain the operation
      of these quantum devices, and a scalable quantum computer could perform
      some calculations exponentially faster[a] than any modern
      <strong>"classical"</strong>
      computer. Theoretically a large-scale quantum computer could break some
      widely used encryption schemes and aid physicists in performing

      impractical, with several obstacles to useful applications.
